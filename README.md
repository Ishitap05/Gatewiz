# Gatewiz
# Digital Logic Design and Simulation using Verilog and SystemVerilog
## Objective
To design, simulate, and test digital logic systems using **Verilog HDL** and **SystemVerilog**, including structured testbenches and waveform-based debugging
## Project Components

### 1. Combinational & Sequential Logic
- Basic gates, multiplexers, adders, decoders
- Latches, D flip-flops, shift registers, counters

### 2. Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- Moore and Mealy machines for sequence detection and control logic
- Synchronous state transitions and state encoding

### 3. Verilog-based Digital Clock
- Real-time hour-minute-second display
- Alarm setting with enable/disable functionality
- Clock division logic for real-time simulation

---

##  Verification Strategy

### Simulation Tools
- **GTKWave** for waveform inspection
- **Icarus Verilog** for compiling and simulating RTL and testbenches

### Testbench Design
- Developed using **SystemVerilog** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**
- Reusable, modular architecture for scalable testing
- Automatic stimulus generation and result checking
